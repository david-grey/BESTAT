# Introduction

Before you go to any new cities, the first question you want to ask is where should I live. You want to find a hotel to enjoy your vacations. You want to seek an apartment to spend your summer. Or you want to buy a house to move in. People make decisions by collecting information from Google, Zillow, Bookings and so on. However, it is so easy to be overwhelmed and ignore some critical information. As a result, most people regret after moving in.

To solve this problem, we propose to develop a web-based GIS application to assist people in site selection. When users click a point, we will be able to offer a living index by aggregating information from multiple APIs. The living index will be calculated based on the business, crimes, transportation, and the living index of different categories will also be demonstrated since different users might have different preferences.
