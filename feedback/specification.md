Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded:

### The product backlog (10/10)

The product backlog is detailed and complete. You assigned each task in each module to a single person. Two minor advice: 1) present the backlog using spreadsheet. It is easy to track and will help you follow to update of the requirements; 2) estimate the cost of each task. That will help you split the task equally, also track the total progress.

### Data models (10/10)

For now, your data model is clear. The relationship between main models is correct. The API calling may have some constraints in practice, you may need to use the database to cache some results if needed.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

The wireframes are pretty clean and easy to understand in general. As we expected, the webapp includes a lot of interactions with the user on the map, so probably in the actual design, a more detailed prototype for map interaction should be made.
